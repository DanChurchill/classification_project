### Stats Test 1: ANOVA Test: One Way

Analysis of variance, or ANOVA, is a statistical method that separates observed variance data into different components to use for additional tests. 

A one-way ANOVA is used for three or more groups of data, to gain information about the relationship between the dependent and independent variables: in this case our clusters vs. the log_error, respectively.

To run the ANOVA test in Python use the following import: \
<span style="color:green">from</span> scipy.stats <span style="color:green">import</span> f_oneway

- f_oneway, in this case, takes in the individual clusters and returns the f-statistic, f, and the p_value, p:
    - the f-statistic is simply a ratio of two variances. 
    - The p_vlaue is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct

#### Hypothesis:
- The null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) is
- The alternate hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>) is 

#### Confidence level and alpha value:
- I established a 95% confidence level
- alpha = 1 - confidence, therefore alpha is 0.05

#### Results:


#### Summary:


### Stats Test 2: T-Test: One Sample, Two Tailed
- A T-test allows me to compare a categorical and a continuous variable by comparing the mean of the continuous variable by subgroups based on the categorical variable
- The t-test returns the t-statistic and the p-value:
    - t-statistic: 
        - Is the ratio of the departure of the estimated value of a parameter from its hypothesized value to its standard error. It is used in hypothesis testing via Student's t-test. 
        - It is used in a t-test to determine if you should support or reject the null hypothesis
        - t-statistic of 0 = H<sub>0</sub>
    -  - the p-value:
        - The probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct
- We wanted to compare the individual clusters to the total population. 
    - Cluster1 to the mean of ALL clusters
    - Cluster2 to the mean of ALL clusters, etc.

#### Hypothesis:
- The null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) is 
- The alternate hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>) is 

#### Confidence level and alpha value:
- I established a 95% confidence level
- alpha = 1 - confidence, therefore alpha is 0.05

## Selecting the Best Model:

### Use Table below as a template for all Modeling results for easy comparison:

| Model | Validation/Out of Sample RMSE | R<sup>2</sup> Value |
| ---- | ----| ---- |
| Baseline | 0.167366 | 2.2204 x 10<sup>-16</sup> |
| Linear Regression (OLS) | 0.166731 | 2.1433 x 10<sup>-3</sup> |  
| Tweedie Regressor (GLM) | 0.155186 | 9.4673 x 10<sup>-4</sup>|  
| Lasso Lars | 0.166731 | 2.2204 x 10<sup>-16</sup> |  
| Quadratic Regression | 0.027786 | 2.4659 x 10<sup>-3</sup> |  


- {} model performed the best
