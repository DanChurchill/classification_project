## <a name="project_description"></a>Project Description:
The purpose of this project is to aquire customer data for the Telco Company from a database, create a model to predict customer churn, and utilize that model to make predictions from a group of customers

Goal 1: Create a model that can predict churn with greater accuracy than baseline

Goal 2: Find drivers for customer churn at Telco and make recommendations to improve retention

### Project Outline:
- Acquire data from the Codeup Database using a function saved in an acquire.py file to import into the Final Report Notebook.
- Perform initial data exploration to determine what preparations the data needs to undergo.
- Clean and prepare data utilizing a function saved in a prepare.py, and prepare data in Final Report Notebook by importing and using the funtion.
- Clearly define two hypotheses, set an alpha, run statistical tests needed to reject or fail to reject the Null Hypothesis, and document findings and takeaways.
- Establish a baseline accuracy.
- Train three different classification models.
- Evaluate models on train and validate datasets.
- Choose the model with that performs the best and evaluate that single model on the test dataset.
- Create csv file with the customer id, the probability that the customer has churned, and the model's prediction for each observation in my test dataset.
- Document conclusions, takeaways, and next steps in the Final Report Notebook.

## <a name="wrangle"></a>Data Acquisition and Preparation

Data is acquired from the Codeup Database server using an SQL query within the modular function get_telco_data located in the acquire.py file.  This returns a dataframe containing 7043 rows and 23 columns of data

Preparation is performed using the modular function prep_telco located in the prepare.py file.  This function performs the following on the data:

- Deletes the id columns that contained redundent information
- Converted total_charges from a string to a float
    * NOTE: There were 11 entries of 0 for total_charges, but in each case the tenure was also 0 indicating they were new customers; no values were imputed because this was a logical value
- Encoded categorical and binary columns using 1-hot encoding
- Renamed some columns for brevity
- Created 'addon_count' column, a count of how many internet add-ons each customer has
- Split Data into 80% Train, 20% Validate, and 20% Test using 'Churn' as stratification

## <a name="explore"></a>Data Exploration:

### Correlation Testing
The first step was to explore each variable's linear correlation using a custom modular function correlation_report located in the explore.py file.  This function accepts a dataframe (in this case our training dataset) and a target column (in this case our target variable 'churn'),  The function performs a correlation test on each column, sorts the absolute values, and returns two tables with the 11 strongest correlations, and the 11 weakest correlations.

Correlation test takeaways:
 - Contract types, internet, payment by check, and not having internet add-ons showed higher correlation to churn
 - Phone service, gender, and multiple lines showed lower correlation to churn

### Exploring Internet Service
The training data was split into subsets of those that did and did not have internet service to see which was more likely to churn. 

- **Hypothesis**
- $H_0$: There is no difference in churn between those with and without internet service
- $H_a$: There is a significant difference in churn between those with and without internet service

We failed to confirm the null hypothesis and confirmed via visualization that customers without internet service were more likely to churn

### Exploring Number of Internet Service Add-Ons
To explore why internet users were more likely to churn we then utilized the add-on_count column by using a $Chi^2$ test

- **Hypothesis**
- $H_0$: 'Churn is independent of the number of add-on services'
- $H_a$: 'Churn is dependent on the number of add-on services'

We failed to confirm the null hypothesis and confirmed via visualization that customers with fewer add-on services were more likely to churn

### Exploring Monthly Charges and Internet Service Add-Ons
We saw that monthly charges correlated to churn, and that more add-ons meant higher churn.  Looking at the breakdown visually we were able to see that customers that paid more for the same number of add-ons churned at a higher rate.


### Takeaways from exploration:
- We've identified that internet customers churn at a higher rate
- Internet customers with fewer add-on services, and those that pay more for internet services, churn more
- Gender, phone service, and multiple lines are our least significant indicators of churn
- During modeling we'll begin with the features we determined to be most important

## <a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion and Next Steps:

- We created a churn classification model that beat the baseline prediction by more than 7%

- The customers that our model predicted as more likely-churned, but who haven't churned yet, should be incentivized to remain customers 

- Customers with Internet Service (particularly those that do not have add-ons) are more likely to churn, especially if their bills are higher.  Making the add-ons less expensive could help retain customers longer.

- Shorter contract types showed higher correlation to churn, and given more time I would have explored that further to determine what other factors drove those customers to churn
